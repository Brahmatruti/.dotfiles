# Excalith Dotfiles
Intended for `MacOS 12.0` and `Ubuntu 22.04`

## Installation
This code will download dotfiles and start installing process depending on your OS
```bash
bash -c "$(wget --no-cache -qO - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/excalith/.dotfiles-new/main/scripts/setup.sh)"
```

## TO-DO
### Ubuntu
- MacOS-like key bindings
- A wayland-compatible WM to act like yabai

### MacOS
- Need a VM to check this setup

## Credits
This dotfiles setup process is heavily inspired / knocked-off version of [Cătălin’s dotfiles](https://github.com/alrra/dotfiles). You should probably check it out instead if you are to fork this. I have changed the way I install packages and symlink config files.
